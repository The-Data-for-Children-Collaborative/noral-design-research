# The Blueprint
> Process and way forward.

## Context

Over the past few months, we have been interacting with several stakeholders from the Northern Alliance region embedded in the Scottish education system. Through these interactions, we conducted [surveys](https://github.com/The-Data-for-Children-Collaborative/noral-user-research/tree/main/research/01-stakeholder-survey), [workshops](https://github.com/The-Data-for-Children-Collaborative/noral-user-research/tree/main/research/02-stakeholder-workshop) and [user interviews](https://github.com/The-Data-for-Children-Collaborative/noral-user-research/tree/main/research/03-stakeholder-interviews) to better understand you and your work. Surveys provided a good understanding of the current landscape and demographics. Workshops engaged the users to critically think of the existing platforms and provide feedback in terms of their experiences.

### 1. Synthesizing information further for the Blueprint

The interviews helped us understand everyday processes better and generate [User Personas and Journeys](https://github.com/The-Data-for-Children-Collaborative/noral-user-research/blob/main/research/personas-and-journeys/) for key stakeholders ; namely [Attainment Advisors](https://github.com/The-Data-for-Children-Collaborative/noral-user-research/blob/main/research/personas-and-journeys/pdf/attainment-dvisors.pdf), [Head Teachers](https://github.com/The-Data-for-Children-Collaborative/noral-user-research/blob/main/research/personas-and-journeys/pdf/head-teachers.pdf), [Quality Improvement Managers](https://github.com/The-Data-for-Children-Collaborative/noral-user-research/blob/main/research/personas-and-journeys/pdf/quality-improvement-managers.pdf) and [Education Psychologists](https://github.com/The-Data-for-Children-Collaborative/noral-user-research/blob/main/research/personas-and-journeys/pdf/educational-psychologist.pdf) ; articulating your requirements from the new solution. Information generated from Stakeholder Interviews spoke more about the individual people's roles and responsibilities along with their challenges and aspirations in the system.

To understand and build feature outlines for the new solution we had to understand the existing platforms and their offering. We conducted two exercises to support our context well:
1.  Design Audit of the Existing Platforms
2.  Comparative Analysis of the Existing Platforms

#### 1.1. Result - Design Audit for existing platform can be found [here](https://github.com/The-Data-for-Children-Collaborative/noral-design-research/tree/main/design-audit)

#### 1.2. What is Comparative Analysis?

A comparative analysis is a strategy where you identify major existing platforms which are trying or have tried to solve problems for more or less the same problem statement. You compare common features for each platform whether they stand in advantage or disadvantage for the users. Also not to forget special features offered by each platform which are their USPs .

Advantages of Comparative Analysis:
-   Comparative analysis can reveal broad trends in the existing platform , again providing the advantage of being able to spot opportunities for differentiating dos and don'ts.
-   Helps you identify your solutions unique value proposition and what makes your solution different from others.
-   Provides you with a benchmark against which you can measure your solution success.

**Result** -  Comparative  Analysis of Existing Landscape solution can be found [here](https://app.mural.co/t/projectnoral3525/m/projectnoral3525/1632113775565/35d9b739b4a018d3289d099bd0ff66b6f18feeaa?sender=u6c0e8b0b180d32aca93e3095)

By conducting Comparative analysis and Design Audit of the existing platforms we derived feature level comparison of what the existing platforms has to offer. Analysis was done on common feature to feature comparison keeping in mind the most important and necessary features that are used by the users. These exercises helped us understand the following questions:

- What is available for the user?
- What is working for the user?
- What can be changed ?
- What can be combined ?
- What can be added?

#### 1.3. Building features for the proposed new solution

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d5usXpkHRdlJg06JhcWVF-nLyTWUM8OPbLsFq0oVMHFIa32hmAnnWDsk42FGd-JQBDxVMMt4cKuecak_4iJQmyBgVFmw9F62wKiG7PmsMKpN3DQ6-4wDDfCJmxOXOk0LeBrEWCU)*Most frequently occurring themes for the new solution envisioned.*

The above word cloud caters to the needs and aspirations of each stakeholder. During the stakeholder interviews every stakeholder had his or her narrative about the platform they have worked with and platform that they aspire to work with. Few terms that constantly came forward as their aspirations like ‘One Stop Shop, Data literacy for all or Data standardization etc.’ These suggestions we have picked and have tried working further which are included as our features or functions in the new solution. Currently we are addressing the landing page for each stakeholder and common pages which are required by each stakeholder to get all the necessary information from the envisioned platform.

### 2. Problem Statement

Every good solution starts with a good problem statement hence we decided to work with 5 W and 1 H Framework. It stands for Who, What, When, Where, Why, and How. Asking relevant questions starting with these interrogative words can streamline the problem solving process. The 5 W 1H framework also sets the context to the bigger picture for which we are trying to solve the problem.

#### Defining the Problem Statement

**_What - What starts by defining what the problem is?_**
To bridge the gap between access to information which can assist stakeholders to understand the attainment related gap around children due to poverty.

**_Who - Who is trying to solve the problem?_**
[CivicDataLab](https://civicdatalab.in/) is partnering with [The Data for Children Collaborative](https://www.dataforchildrencollaborative.com/) to determine what data sources and techniques can best reflect the challenges of child poverty, and subsequently provide means to assess poverty related attainment gaps.

**_Where - Where is the problem situated?_**
The problem is addressed across the Northern Alliance region of Scotland

**_Whom - For whom are we trying to solve the problem?_**
The Northern Alliance Education system has Primary and Secondary stakeholders. Primary stakeholders are ones who have direct engagement and impact with systems like Attainment Advisors, Quality Improvement Officers , Head Teachers and Educational Psychologists. Secondary stakeholders can be defined as stakeholders who have indirect effect or impact like Research Assistants, NIF advisors etc.

**_Why - What is the purpose of Solving this problem?_**
The major goal here is to enable key stakeholders to use data in understanding the role of poverty in a child’s education.

**_How - How are we trying to address this problem?_**
The problem can be addressed by leveraging a platform that caters to individual needs of the stakeholders and empowers them to share their learnings.

By defining the problem statement it helped us to define the purpose and objective of the larger context for which we are solving the problem for. It also helped in scoping the future path to build the narrative for the proposed new solution which we will see below.

### 3. Directions for the Future Scope of Wireframes

> Users are liberated when they can share their learning with other sets of users about their experiences, processes and outcomes. It encourages parallel learning within the ecosystem.

The above features were then used and detailed as per the individual user requirements catering to their needs and day to day activities around data and functionality.

Broader level user flows were generated as a brainstorming exercise to understand the following things:

1.  Broad level Information Architecture  
2.  Hierarchy
3.  Navigation
4.  Functionality of the feature

#### 3.1. In Process - ‘Wireframes’

Keeping in mind all the insights gained from the several stakeholder engagements we have also generated preliminary wireframes with the help of user flows which showcases the first cut trailer of how the platform will shape for each user.

**What are wireframes?**
A wireframe is a schematic or blueprint that is useful for helping you, or your stakeholders to think, communicate and review about the structure of the platform you're building.

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/CngUt3QKDw8mks59TmOmcMqkG3cwrbLaHByj-HSLpjqaJqgtnfqC-VcQPK_vBuwXwAkzezQ8-W128nhMEGuKi-z8SMoGAWHVBXNE5-lSiNzxOtlDhsiCT1dLUYZo_O74bAubhrg)

**Why are we showcasing wireframes?**

- **Wireframes make it clear that this is not the final design** : No one could mistake a wireframe for the final look and feel of your application. Low-fidelity and few colors force you to focus on structure over details. There will be lots of time for visual design once the structure is finalized.
- **Wireframes convey that “this is all up for discussion”** :  The rough feel encourages discussion. We call it a look no one is afraid to criticize. Wireframes are really quick to make, so don't be shy with giving feedback! Each screen probably only took a few minutes to make; don't worry, their author won't mind doing them over from scratch. What matters the most at this point is the final ease of use, so going through a few iterations is normal and expected.
- **Wireframes make it clear that no code has been written yet** : If a stakeholder received some screens that looked like screenshots of the final app, instead of a wireframe, they might assume that all the code behind those screenshots had already been written. This is most often not the case. Wireframes don't have this danger.

The wider objective within this initial phase was to work with stakeholders to identify the shared knowledge gap across local authorities, identify the most appropriate indicators and map the suitable data sources that can be used at the school catchment aggregation. With this goal in mind we tried addressing the aspirations and frustrations of each stakeholder while developing the wireframes. Each stakeholder has a dedicated space planned on the platform with functions that are suitable and inlined with their requirements and needs.

With the above objective we have generated the following wireframes:

|  |  |
|:--:|:--:|
| Attainment Advisor | Educational Psychologist |
| Head Teacher | Quality Improvement Officers |

## Conclusion

Wireframes are blueprints of the bigger picture that is envisaged. Qualitative Feedback from the stakeholders will help the designers realign their goals and design decisions as per your needs. It will ensure that the user journey for the solution is further aligned to the user goals of your role.

This will help us to create a pathway for the Phase 2 process where each feature will be detailed and developed with the help of Data and functionality.
