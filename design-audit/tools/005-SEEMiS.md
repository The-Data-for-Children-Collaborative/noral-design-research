## Design Audit

### Visibility of system status

-   Navigations are not easily accessible. It is sometimes hard to identify where exactly the user is on the system.
    

### Match between system and the real world

-  Couldn't evaluate due to limited access to tool & information.
    

### User control and freedom

-   Menus are overloaded with information. Three levels of dropdown menus isn't considered as a good UX practice.

### Consistency and standards

-   Unclear and sometimes even confusing actionable buttons.

### Error prevention

-  Couldn't evaluate due to limited access to tool & information.
    

### Recognition rather than recall

-   There are no fixed rules of placing the major actionable/buttons across the system.

### Flexibility and efficiency of use

-   Some of the major actionables have been placed together. It can cause confusion and make it complex for a user to access the platform.

### Aesthetic and minimalist design

-   Inefficient use of available space at any view.
-   The information hierarchy needs a lot of improvement. Users might fail to draw relationships between connected information/components due to this issue.
