# Design Audit Methodology

## Design Audit

Design consistency has the power to influence the experience of users of any digital product. An inconsistently designed product can directly affect user trust and likability negatively. Design Audit for such inconsistent products comes into play here. It is considered as a preventive checkup of a digital product, performed by design experts to identify the deficiencies and the ideal experience.

In a design audit, the design experts thoroughly examine all elements of a digital product based on their business objectives, metrics, and usability standards. They then list down the areas of improvement and recommend solutions to improve the overall experience.

## Objectives

The core objective of conducting a design audit is to evaluate the interactions between a digital product and its users. These interactions come in a wide range and majorly influence the user experience or a product.

It is very natural for business owners, managers, founders, designers and developers to get too close to their product and avoid noticing the essential flaws in those interactions. Here Design Audits provide an unbiased and objective view of a product’s strengths and weaknesses and provide actionable design direction.

## Requirements

At its core, a design audit requires assessing all forms of visual, written, and verbal communication. Some of them are mentioned below  

-   Website
-   Style Guide or Design System
-   Workshops & Webinars
-   Social Media
-   Ads, etc.  
    

If we are conducting the design audit specifically for any tool or platform focusing mainly on their usability, then we must have access or understanding of all the points mentioned below:  

-   Access to the tool/platform
-   Tool/platform guidebooks
-   Using Tutorials
-   Objective
-   Features, etc.  

It is important to understand how users go through dozens, if not hundreds, of touch points in their journey to and through your product. Through a design audit, we get to know if the user experience is consistent and trustworthy, or erratic and unpredictable.

## Evaluation Criteria

### Previous Product Requirements

It becomes important to have all the possible details of a product’s background, its scope of use and the objective, since these details eventually help us understand why certain design decisions have been made the way they are. It also helps in writing up viable recommendations.

### Stakeholder Interviews or User Surveys

As a part of the user research we end up collecting various comments & feedback for a product from the user itself. These comments & feedback can be categorized into likes, dislikes and improvinto ements. We can later segregate the similar findings and combine them into a single statement.

### Visual Branding Audit

We must inspect and understand different design collateral (ads, social media posts, website- desktop & mobile versions, mobile apps, business cards etc.) that form important touch points for a customer to notice patterns and deviations. Evaluation of this material will help in recognizing inconsistencies in tone and voice that need to be normalized to seem more authentic as a brand.

### Heuristics Evaluation

Heuristic evaluation is a thorough assessment of a product’s user interface, and its purpose is to detect usability issues that may occur when users interact with a product, and identify ways to resolve them.

The heuristic evaluation process is conducted against a predetermined set of usability principles known as heuristics. The process relies on in-depth tests run by several usability experts at a time.

Although there are numerous heuristics, the most commonly used criteria in usability inspection were developed by Jacob Nielsen in 1995, known as the [Heuristics for User Interface Design](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/).

### Website & Mobile Analytics:

We must inspect and understand different design collateral (ads, social media posts, website- desktop & mobile versions, mobile apps, business cards etc.) that form important touch points for a customer to notice patterns and deviations. Evaluation of this material will help in recognizing inconsistencies in tone and voice that need to be normalized to seem more authentic as a brand.

## Exercise Outputs

### One document

One comprehensive document including various findings in detail with next steps depending on the purpose of having a Design Audit. Mentioning all the details one can possibly include in the final Design Audit document below:

-   Critical usability issues
-   Quick wins
-   A/B test suggestions
-   Mention any trends or tendencies over a period of time
-   Impact of features
-   List of potential areas to improve etc.
