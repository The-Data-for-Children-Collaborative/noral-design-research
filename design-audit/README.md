# Design Audit
> Key observations from a comprehensive audit of the existing tool landscape.

## Background

The Scottish Government’s ambition is for Scotland to be the best place to grow up. To achieve that it is required to raise attainment and reduce educational inequity for all of Scotland’s children and young people. The Scottish education system works well for most children and young people, who make good progress in their learning. However, there is still a gap between the least and most deprived areas in terms of attainment and socioeconomic status.

The data and the tools are driven by data play a key role to help the Scottish education system identify, understand, and achieve this larger goal of reducing the attainment and socioeconomics gap. These available tools are used by major stakeholders and assist them to create a better school improvement framework and also support them to give the contextual analysis.

# Methodology

Our methodology for performing a design audit exercise involves analyzing all the design elements used across a digital platform/tool in order to ensure the usability measures branding is consistent across the channel. Detailed documentation of the Design Audit Methodology can be found [here](_methodology.md).

## Tools Reviewed

Design audits played a significant role in the process of solving a larger problem focusing on improving education and reducing the poverty-related attainment gap in Scotland. These design audits gave us various insights into the users' expectations, their ways of interaction with tools, and in evaluating these tools as per general design standards. As a part of design audit exercise CivicDataLab performed the evaluation for all five tools mentioned below:  

1.  [Insight](tools/001-Insight.md)
2.  [SIMD](tools/002-SIMD.md)
3.  [BGE Tool Kit](tools/003-BGE-Toolkit.md)
4.  [NIF Interactive Evidence Report](tools/004-NIF-Interactive-Evidence-Report.md)
5.  [SEEMiS](tools/005-SEEMiS.md)
 
This report summarizes the key observations and divided them into three main buckets i.e. **Usability Issues**, **User Preferences** & **Feature Requests**.

# Summary

## Usability Issues

-   Existing tools are having common usability issues since most of them were designed a decade ago. Users find it slightly tough to navigate through the different functionalities because they are outdated in a way. It is because users spend most of their time on other sites and they prefer a website or tool to work the same way as all the other sites they already know.
-   Higher-level stakeholders (e.g. The Director of Education) found most of the tools user-friendly and flexible but at the same time, comparatively lower-level stakeholders (e.g. School Teachers) found it complex, cumbersome, and time-consuming to use.
-   Tools or platforms aren't designed in a way that can serve any user from a large range of stakeholders and only an expert of this tool can drill down well and draw better insights.
-   The data is available and can provide all the needed information but only trained individuals can search, interrogate and manipulate it.
-   Several usability issues with the tool. E.g. Ambiguous Navigation, Complex Functionality, Clunky Interface, Slow Processing, Inconsistently Designed, Poor Understanding of Tool, etc. Hence the tools are too complicated to operate, not easily accessible, and used widely.    
-   Most of the tools available are not web-based hence not easily accessible and used widely.  

## User Preferences

To have a range of databases in one place helps to have a bird-eye view of the landscape. More preferable if the data are broken down nicely into different levels to create an understanding for individual settings.

-   Collect more granular level data to create an impact on school-level settings. Comparatively less skewed granular data helps in better comparison between same-level settings, further analysis, and validations.
-   The data needs to be updated on a regular basis.
-   The platform should not be limited to the applications of a data-driven platform but also generate data stories around the information like Leavers Destinations, Attainment Gaps, Pupils Additional Needs, etc.
-   The platform should meet security requirements for holding data and sets boundaries for different staff members.
-   The platform should have national consistency and works commonly across all local authorities. It should respond to local authority requests more frequently.
-   Prefer to keep the platform separate for early years and later year pupils.
-   The division of a large geographical area into smaller data zones gives a better understanding of ground-level settings.

## Feature Request

-   More filters that enable users to drill down manually or presets of certain deep dive filters.
-   Flexible enough to allow custom-made adaptations to programs.
-   Ability to track the historical trajectory of the pupils.
-   Systems should be able to make predictions for future trends by processing the existing data.
-   Introduction of multiple means to understand the actual reason for deprivation.
-   Ability to virtually compare similar levels of settings. This visual comparator helps individual settings in better benchmarking and self-evaluation.
-   Integration with other platforms like the BGE tool.
-   Ability to navigate from map view to spreadsheet.
-   Ability to download or print the analysis reports. 

## Conclusion

The Design Audit of existing platforms/tools is one part of a whole User Research process. It is performed parallelly (but independently) with other user research activities like Stakeholder Workshops, User Interviews, Moscow Prioritization, User Journey Mapping, etc. to use the findings in the next phase of the process for validations and better design decisions. All the key observations drawn from the Design Audit exercise can be used further as the next steps in the process as mentioned below.

### Next Steps

-   To consider all usability issues while designing the Wireframes and Visual Designs.
-   To include the insights drawn from the user preferences into the User Journey Mapping.
-   To place the recommended features appropriately into the Wireframes and Visual Designs.
