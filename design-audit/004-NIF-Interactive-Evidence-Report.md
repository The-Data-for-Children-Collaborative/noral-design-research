## About Tool

### Background

NIF Interactive Evidence Report is developed by SG Education Analytical Services on the platform called Tableau Public. It is a free platform for publicly sharing and exploring data visualisations online.

The Scottish Government reviews the NIF annually and publishes an Improvement Plan which is informed by priorities drawn from the regional, local, and school level improvement plans. It is also informed by the data set out in the NIF Interactive Evidence Report.

### Objective

[The National Improvement Framework](https://education.gov.scot/parentzone/learning-in-scotland/national-improvement-framework) (NIF) aims to bring together a range of information about how well children and young people are doing in education, and the drivers for improvement that are known to impact on this.

Information in the NIF Report is supposed to help teachers, local authorities, and the Scottish Government learn from good practice, and develop plans where further improvements are needed.

### Fetatures

NIF Interactive Evidence Report provides a wide range of information of major stakeholders. Sometimes the provided information drills down to individual schools, local authorities, or sometimes it is only available at a national level.

## Methodology

Our methodology for performing a design audit exercise involves analyzing all the design elements used across a digital platform/tool in order to ensure the usability measures branding is consistent across the channel. A detailed documentation of Design Audit Methodology can be found [here](https://github.com/The-Data-for-Children-Collaborative/noral-design-research/blob/main/design-audit/000%20Methodology.md).

## What Users Say

### Improvements

1.  Better if we have more granular data.
    

## Design Audit

### Visibility of system status

-   Since the only way to navigate from one page to another is this series of tab-like buttons, one can easily miss out on noticing the difference between the active and inactive state of these buttons and might feel lost in the system.

### Match between system and the real world

-   Couldn't evaluate due to limited access to tool & information.
    
### User control and freedom

-   Users are high likely to click on the shown button since it conveys the functionality of going back to the previous page but it actually takes users all the way back to the Content Listing page.

### Consistency and standards

-   Couldn't evaluate due to limited access to tool & information.

### Error prevention

-   Couldn't evaluate due to limited access to tool & information.
    
### Recognition rather than recall

-   Users can switch from any internal page to another one by expanding the navigation dropdown. The only drawback with this dropdown navigation is it is having incomplete information about the page. It shows only numbers but not the page headings and we cannot expect users to memorize everything.

### Flexibility and efficiency of use

-   The system takes considerably a long time to boot.

### Aesthetic and minimalist design

-   Since the whole interface is carrying the form of a report, all the details have shown in the portrait mode hence there is a poor use of available space that eventually disturbing the visual hierarchy of all pages.

-   Since the interface is portrait mode, one can easily miss out on seeing the options like download, undo, redo, reset, share, etc. that lie at the bottom of the page.
-   Users can easily misinterpret the Undo and redo icons with the functionality of going to Next and Previous Page.

-   Inappropriately designed and placed “Go to Content” button.
