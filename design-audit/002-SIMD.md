# About Tool

## Background

SIMD is a tool for identifying the places in Scotland where people are experiencing disadvantage across different aspects of their lives. It has been used to help organisations invest in those areas that need it most.

## Objective

The applications of SIMD enables communities to highlight the things that matter to them, and identify opportunities to improve the lives of local people. SIMD can also be useful to describe the general areas where people live and some of the challenges that they face there. It aims to create an understanding within the communities about local assets and aspirations and how one can better engage with them for more successful and sustainable community regeneration - to everyone's benefit.

## Fetatures

SIMD shows a relative measure of deprivation across small areas in Scotland by looking at multiple reasons for deprivation.

Communities further can use this tool as per their attainment interventions:
-   Compare overall deprivation of small areas.
-   Compare the seven domains of deprivation.
-   Compare the proportion of small areas in a council that are very deprived.
-   Find areas where many people experience multiple deprivation.
-   Find areas of greater need for support and intervention.

Detailed information on the various measures can be found [here](https://www.gov.scot/publications/scottish-index-multiple-deprivation-2020/pages/1/).

# Methodology

Our methodology for performing a design audit exercise involves analyzing all the design elements used across a digital platform/tool in order to ensure the usability measures branding is consistent across the channel. A detailed documentation of Design Audit Methodology can be found [here](https://insight-guides.scotxed.net/).

# What User Say

## Mental Model

	TBD

## Likes

1.  Large database helps in having a bird-eye view of the landscape.
2.  Division of a large geographical area into smaller data zones.
3.  Multiple means of deprivation.

## Dislikes

1.  Unable to navigate from map view to spreadsheet.

## Improvements

1.  More filters.
2.  Granular level data for rural areas.

# Design Audit

## Visibility of system status

-   Filters are not giving the feedback if they are selected or not. In some cases if they are even giving the feedback then it is failing to be relevant.

## Match between system and the real world

-   Need to double check if all our stakeholders and prospective users are well aware of terms like Deciles, Data Zones, Council Areas, Postcodes etc.

## User control and freedom

-   The selected data zone and its multiple deprivation details change rapidly as the cursor moves anywhere on the map. It makes the system quirky and out of control initially.
-   Buttons, Filters and Links, all having exactly the same visual traits. There are higher chances for users to accidentally hit a link and unwillingly move to another page.

## Consistency and standards

-   The layout of the page can be less ambiguous and follow the mainstream pattern. E.g. google maps
 
# Error prevention

-   Null

# Recognition rather than recall

-   Null
   
# Flexibility and efficiency of use

-   The grouping of filters can be better. For example, Go to Datazone or Go to Postcodes are not even filters and better if use them as search functionality on map.

## Aesthetic and minimalist design

-   The dashboard is divided into three main columns i.e. Filters, Map & Deprivation Information. The information architecture within the columns and in combined columns is not smooth.
-   The default view of the map is full of information that is hard to process at first go. It actually increases the cognitive load in the user's mind and slows down the process of accessing information for other areas as well.
-   Buttons, Filters and Links, all having exactly the same visual traits.
-   Major information has been shown using the smallest font size in the system, making it less noticeable.
-   The visual representation of deprivation and ranking details might fail to deliver the right information due to the inappropriate alignment of icons and the size of fonts.
-   Social media links can be placed less prominently.
