## About Tool

### Background

Insight is the professional benchmarking tool for analysing attainment data in the [senior phase](https://education.gov.scot/education-scotland/scottish-education-system/senior-phase-and-beyond/senior-phase/), accessible by secondary schools, establishments and local authorities. Some of the key information about Insight tool are shown below:

 - It is a closed access web based tool/platform.
 -   Mostly used by Secondary schools in Scotland focuses on the [Senior Phase](https://education.gov.scot/education-scotland/scottish-education-system/senior-phase-and-beyond/senior-phase/) of education.
 -   The user base of Insight Tools includes professionals like the Director of Education, Heads of Services, Quality Improvement Officers, Head Teachers, Deputy Head Teachers, Principle Teachers (managing departments), Head of Faculty, etc.
 -   It is a Virtual Comparator for pupils across various levels of the system (school to national) with similar characteristics.
    

### Objective

Insight is designed to support self-evaluation and provide schools with their attainment information in a format that makes it straightforward to identify possible areas for improvement for young people in S4 to S6.

### Fetatures

Insight allows schools to compare their performance to the performance of a virtual comparator, made up of pupils from schools in other local authorities who have similar key demographic characteristics (gender, deprivation, additional support needs and stage of leaving / latest stage) to the pupils in your school.

Upon logging into Insight and agreeing to the protocol, you will land on the National Measures Dashboard for your establishment. The Dashboard includes the four dashboard measures.

1.  **Literacy & Numeracy:** the performance of your school in pupilsâ€™ attainment in literacy and numeracy at the point of exit from school.
2.  **Leaver Initial Destinations:** The performance of your school in the percentage of pupils going on to positive initial destinations.
3.  **Attainment for All:** How well cohorts of young people with differing learning abilities from within your establishment compare against their Virtual Comparator peers with similar characteristics. The pupils are split into groups (Lowest 20%, Middle 60%, Highest 20% of attainment) as a percentage of the total selected cohort.
4.  **Attainment in the Context of Deprivation:** A comparison of average attainment (in the context of total tariff points achieved per pupil) for pupils within each of the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) deciles.

Detailed information on the various measures can be found [here](https://insight-guides.scotxed.net/).

# Methodology

Our methodology for performing a design audit exercise involves analyzing all the design elements used across a digital platform/tool in order to ensure the usability measures branding is consistent across the channel. A detailed documentation of Design Audit Methodology can be found [here](https://github.com/The-Data-for-Children-Collaborative/noral-design-research/blob/main/design-audit/000%20Methodology.md).

# What Users Say

## Mental Model

	TBD
    
## Likes

1.  Higher level stakeholders (e.g. The Director of Education) found it user friendly and flexible.
2.  An expert of this tool can drill down well and draw better insights.
3.  The large range of data is very helpful when analyzing national-level systems.

## Dislikes
1.  Unable to use regularly.
2.  Comparatively lower level stakeholders (e.g. School Teachers) found it complex, cumbersome and time-consuming to use.
3.  Data available for the analysis of school level systems are very small and skewed.
4.  It is challenging to validate comparisons or analysis using smaller and skewed data sets.
5.  It doesn't gather all the information. E.g. Leaver Destination.
6.  Several usability issues with the tool. E.g. i.e. Ambiguous Navigation, Complex Functionality, Poor Understanding of Tool etc.

## Improvements
1.  FAQs for quick resolution.
2.  Presets of certain Deep Dive filters.
3.  More data (but less skewed) for better analysis of school level systems.
4.  Ability to filter data for particular a category (e.g Additional Support Needs) of young people.
5.  Ability to track the historical trajectory of the pupils.
6.  Ability to download or print the analysis reports.
    

# Design Audit

## Visibility of system status

-   No difference if it is System Dashboard, Personal Dashboard, Home Page or any Internal Page. The breadcrumbs, Active/Inactive Tabs, Different Page Headers are missing and this is making it difficult to make a difference between several pages.
-   Unclear navigation - Unable to differentiate between filters and navigation/header menus. All major CTA that take users to the next phase of information are on the top which is quite unusual

-   The interface gives the same feedback whether the filters are applied or not applied at all. It certainly creates confusion and eventually puts users into a lost state.

## Match between system and the real world

-   Jargons used across the platform e.g. abbreviation under View Option, typical units name on graphs, etc. There are a range of stakeholders using the same platform and for some of them, it might be easy to understand all the jargon, but it creates a major understanding gap for others.

## User control and freedom

-   Every page is flooded with information. There should be a way of unfolding the information only if asked or in a step by step fashion.

## Consistency and standards

-   Navigation/Header Menu and View Options have similar visual traits. Thus, unable to make a clear statement about the level of information/functionality they are delivering.

-   Hard to differentiate between Active Buttons, Inactive Buttons and Dropdown. It is also affecting the Visual Hierarchy of the whole page.

## Error prevention

-   Null
    

## Recognition rather than recall

-   Similar kinds of information laid out differently on different pages.
    

## Flexibility and efficiency of use

-   Complex functionality of selecting a/many Deep Dive filters.

## Aesthetic and minimalist design

-   Overwhelmed with information at first glance.
-   Plenty of unused white space available.
-   Page Layout might need several improvements since the Visual and Information hierarchy is breaking at many levels.
-   Inappropriately designed and placed buttons for Add to Personal Dashboard, Download Data and Show/Hide Table.
-   Harmony is missing in the used color scheme for graphs.
-   Charts on Dashboard are actually clickable and take users to the next level of information source but visually they are failing to communicate it. Spacing is another issue here.

## Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors

-   Null
    

## Help and documentation

-   Users might not go through the long and lengthy documentation for any query, help and support. FAQ section with the ability to search for any specific keyword might work better for quick resolution.
