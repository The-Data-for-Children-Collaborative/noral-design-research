## About Tool

### Background

BGE Benchmarking Tool is a Scottish Government toolkit which enables headteachers and local authority officers to consider school data in relation to national comparator schools. It works based on the impact of pupil characteristics including SIMD, Gender, FSM, Ethnicity, EAL, Gaelic Medium, Denomination and Urban/Rural.

The BGE Benchmarking tool contains national, local authority and school-level data that have been provided by schools, via local authorities, in the **Achievement of CfE Levels** and **Pupil Census** data collection returns. This has been data disclosed to protect the identity of individual children. The Tool is provided to assist colleagues in the delivery of their professional duties. To prevent any misuse of the data it contains access should be on a strictly need-to-know basis.

### Objective

The BGE Benchmarking Tool is provided to all education authorities and schools on the understanding that it will be used for self evaluation, professional reflection and benchmarking purposes only. It is intended to help stimulate dialogue and improvement activity by providing a means for encouraging a better understanding of the approaches being taken by schools across local authorities to improve the educational outcomes for all children and young people.

### Fetatures

Through the tool, schools can access a range of options to enable dialogue about improvement through various features mention below:
-   School summary
-   Actual score vs. Comparator score
-   Set a target for the school
-   Identify how many pupils need to improve CfE level
-   Distribution of CfE levels and other characteristics
-   Find a similar primary schools
-   Find a similar secondary schools
-   Schools comparison
-   Area comparison
-   National comparison
    

## Methodology

Our methodology for performing a design audit exercise involves analyzing all the design elements used across a digital platform/tool in order to ensure the usability measures branding is consistent across the channel. A detailed documentation of Design Audit Methodology can be found [here](https://github.com/The-Data-for-Children-Collaborative/noral-design-research/blob/main/design-audit/000%20Methodology.md).

## What User Say

### Mental Model

	TBD
    
### Likes

1.  Provide virtual comparators for schools.
2.  Large data sets for individual settings.
3.  Similar schools' collaboration helps individual schools in better benchmarking and self-evaluation.

### Dislikes

1.  The tool is too complicated to operate.
2.  Not easily accessible and used widely.
3.  It is challenging to validate comparisons or analysis using smaller and skewed data sets.

### Improvements

1.  Frequently updating data.
2.  Granular level data to create an impact on all sizes of school settings.

## Design Audit

### Visibility of system status

-   All the information shown on a page is the result of selecting filters from on the top. Those selected filters go off the screen when drilled down to access all the information on the page and it might result in failing to draw a relationship between selected filters and shown results.

-   The page is overloaded with various pieces of information, but the poor visual hierarchy might be a reason for the users to fail in drawing a relationship between two related pieces of information.

-   There is a spacing issue in two sets of information with the not clear enough headings.

### Match between system and the real world

-   Need to double check if all our stakeholders and prospective users are well aware of terms like CfE Level, FSM, Ethnicity, EAL, Gaelic Medium etc.

### User control and freedom

-   Couldn't evaluate due to limited access to tool & information.
    
### Consistency and standards

-   Couldn't evaluate due to limited access to tool & information.
    
### Error prevention

-   Couldn't evaluate due to limited access to tool & information.
    
### Recognition rather than recall

-   The help text on the top is not really prominent and users can easily miss out on reading it.

-   It would be better if Inputs become common and fixed when comparing local authority or school settings in order to avoid extra efforts and any error in the system.

### Flexibility and efficiency of use

-   Training required to use the tool.
-   If the filter works best with choosing “one option per filter” then there is no need to give “multiple selection” functionality. Long list of schools and complex functionality of filtration.

-   No need to set the same filters again and again if we are to compare two local authority or school settings.

-   At some places in the system there are so many filters to select manually in order to compare two local authority or school settings. It is clearly a lot of work for a user to get what they want.

### Aesthetic and minimalist design

-   Filters play the major functions on this platform yet they are not really prominent visually.

-   Extremely long pages loaded with several pieces of information making the page clutter enough.
-   Notification or information bar is not really prominent and users can easily miss out on reading it.

-   Helping messages are not clear and appear to be irrelevant at times.
